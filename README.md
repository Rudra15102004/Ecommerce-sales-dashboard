README - E-Commerce Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard
Introduction
This project is part of the Data Analytics Internship assessment, where the objective was to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard using a realistic e-commerce sales dataset. The dashboard aims to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by analyzing KPIs, sales performance, customer behavior, and trends.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- Ecommerce_Insights.pbix : Power BI dashboard file.
- Ecommerce_Sales_Insights_Report.docx : Final report describing the dataset, problem statement, approach, and insights.
- README.docx : This file, providing project overview and usage instructions.
Dataset Information
The dataset used is a realistic e-commerce sales dataset with over 200 rows, containing multiple related tables:
- FactSales: Transactions data (Order Date, Quantity, Sales Amount, Profit, etc.)
- Customers: Customer demographics (CustomerID, Age, Gender, Region)
- Products: Product details (ProductName, Category, UnitPrice)
- Calendar: Generated table for time analysis (Date, Year, Month, Quarter)

The data was cleaned, modeled into a star schema, and enriched with calculated columns and DAX measures.
How to Use
1. Open the `E Commerce sales.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Explore the dashboard using the provided slicers (Year, Category, Region, Gender).
3. Drill down in charts for detailed insights (e.g., Category â†’ Product).
4. Review KPIs at the top of the dashboard for a quick summary of business performance.
5. Refer to the `Ecommerce_Sales_Insights_Report.docx` file for a detailed explanation of insights.
Expected Outcome
The dashboard enables users to:
- Track overall sales and profitability.
- Analyze sales by category, region, gender, and product.
- Identify seasonal sales patterns.
- Gain insights into customer behavior.
- Support strategic decision-making through data-driven insights.
